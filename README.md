# Asteroid-Armageddon-Simulation
This project simulates an end of the world senario with a giant asteroid.

Setting: "In the near distant future, the Earth is at war against a race of giant intelligent alien insects! 
Little is known about the Bugs except that they are intent on the eradication of all human life." (COPYWRITE by Touchstone Pictures) 
A few humans go back in time to inform you that in the Bugs first wave of attack against humanity, 
a giant asteroid will impact the Earth wiping out more than half of Earth's total population. 
Unfortunately you have only ONE year before the giant asteroid impacts the Earth! 
In a desperate attempt to avert the asteroid's collision path away from Earth, you assemble 
all of the planet's Weapons of Mass Destruction and prepare rockets to launch the payloads into 
deep space.
WILL YOU SAVE THE WORLD FROM IMPEDING DOOM?!
